  Boats Sail On The Rivers  Boats sail on the rivers,And ships sail on the seas;But clouds that sail across the sky,Are prettier far than these.There are bridges on the rivers,As pretty as you please;<br>&mbsp;&mbsp;&mbsp;&mbsp;&mbsp;&mbsp;But the bow that bridges heaven,And overtops the trees,And builds a road from earth to sky,Is prettier far than these.
