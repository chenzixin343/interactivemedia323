  <p><strong>Separate the sweaters by color if you’re washing more than one.</strong>Dark-colored<br>dyes can bleed a bit when you’re hand-washing, so you’d likely have to change the<br>water before moving on to the light colors if you washed the darks first.[2] Therefore, if<br>you’re hand-washing more than one sweater and the sweaters vary in color, separate them<br>into two piles – one for light colors and one for dark. That way, once you’re ready to wash,<br>you’ll already have them separated so you can easily wash the light-colored pile first.[3]</p>
   <ul>
    <li>In most cases, you’ll be able to use the same wash set-up for all the sweaters as<br>long as you wash the light colors first.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Turn the sweater(s) that you’re washing inside-out.</strong>
 	Before hand-washing your<br> sweater, reach up into the sweater and pull the sleeves through to flip it so that the<br> inside is facing out. This will minimize friction while you wash, keeping the outside of the<br> sweater from pilling.[4]</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you’re hand-washing more than one sweater, repeat this for all of the sweaters<br>you’re washing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <p><strong>Fill up a clean sink with room temperature water.</strong>First, wipe down your sink with<br>an all-purpose cleaning wipe or spray and a paper towel. Rinse the sink with water to<br>remove any cleaner residue. Then, fill the sink with room temperature water.[5]</p>
<ul>
  <li>While warm water tends to be more effective at removing stains, it could make the<br>dyes in your sweater bleed or cause the sweater to shrink after you wash.[6]</li>
  <li>You can also use a shallow plastic or enamel wash basin.[7]</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>
<strong>
Add about 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of a gentle detergent to the water.</strong>Pour 1<br>teaspoon (4.9 mL) of low-alkaline laundry detergent or baby shampoo into the filled<br>sink or wash basin. Swish the detergent around in the<br>water until it’s combined and the water is sudsy.[8]</p>
<ul>
  <li>While you can measure, the amount of detergent doesn’t need to be precise here –<br>you’ll just need enough detergent so that the water gets sudsy.</li>
  <li>If you’re washing a particularly large or thick sweater, or multiple sweaters, you can<br>add a bit more detergent, about 1 tablespoon (15 mL).[9]</li>
  <li>Low-alkaline detergents and baby shampoo are gentler on fabrics than high-<br>alkaline detergents. Therefore, it’s particularly important that you choose a low-<br>alkaline detergent when hand-washing cashmere, wool, or any other delicate<br>fabric.[10]</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Mix in white vinegar if you want to neutralize odors.</strong>If the sweater(s) you’re<br>washing smell as a result of perspiration, stains, or any other reason, mix 3⁄4 cup<br>(180 mL) of white vinegar into the detergent water. Swish the vinegar around until it’s<br>combined.[11]</p>

<p><strong>
Place one sweater in the soapy water and swirl it around.</strong> First, push the sweater<br>down into the water to make sure that it’s completely submerged. Then, use your<br>hands to gently swirl it around in the water in a circular motion for about 2 minutes.[12]</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure that you don’t pull, tug, or rub the fabric together, as this can cause the<br>sweater to lose its shape.[13]</li>
  <li>If you’re washing more than one sweater, make sure that you start with a light-<br>colored sweater first.[14]</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>
Leave the sweater to soak for 5 to 10 minutes.</strong>This will give the detergent time to<br>seep into the fabric and break down any stains. If the sweater is particularly dirty or<br>has a stubborn stain, you may want to gently swish it around every so often to stir up<br>the detergent.[15]</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Remove the sweater from the water and squeeze out the excess water.</strong>After<br>letting it soak, lift the sweater out of the water and hold it over the sink or washbasin.<br>Ball or roll it up loosely, then squeeze it very gently to remove some of the excess water.[16]</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure that you don’t twist the sweater to wring it out, as this can stretch it<br>out.[17]</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p><strong>
Roll the sweater in a clean towel to start to dry.</strong>Lay out a clean towel on a flat<br>surface. Then, lay the sweater on top of the towel, making sure that it doesn’t hang<br>over the sides of the towel anywhere. Starting at the top, slowly roll the towel with the<br>sweater inside. Press down lightly on the roll to get the towel to absorb more water, then<br>slowly unroll the towel and sweater back open.[18]</p>
<ul>
  <li>At this point, if the towel has gotten really soaked, you may want to replace it with a<br>dry towel to speed up the drying process.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>
Leave the sweater to dry completely.</strong>If the sweater appears wrinkly at all, use your<br>hand to smooth out it out as much as possible. Then, leave the sweater to lay on the<br>towel until its completely dry and ready to be worn.[19]</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you’re washing more than one sweater, you can start repeating this process to<br>wash another sweater while the first sweater is drying.[20]</li>
  <li>Instead of a towel, you can also lay the sweater out to dry on a drying rack.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>
Fluff the sweater in the dryer if the fabric is dryer-safe.</strong>First, check the tag of the<br>sweater to make sure that the fabric is dryer-safe. If it is, you can use the dryer to<br>finish drying the sweater and fluff it up. To do this, keep the sweater inside-out and put it in<br>the dryer on a low spin, low heat cycle to keep it from shrinking. Let it tumble dry for a few<br>minutes, depending on how damp it was when you put it in.[21]</p>
<ul>
  <li>Generally, sweaters made out of cotton, acrylic, polyester, and linen are dryer-safe.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Use a steamer to remove any wrinkles. </strong>Once the sweater is dry, you can use a<br>steamer to remove any wrinkles left from the hand-washing process. To steam the<br>sweater, hang it up on a hanger or lay it out on a flat surface. Then, run the steamer down<br>the sweater in long strokes, making sure that you put the steamer on the right fabric<br>setting.[22]</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you steamed the sweater on a hanger, you’ll likely want to remove it from the<br>hanger after so that the sweater doesn’t get any shoulder bump indentions from<br>he hanger.[23]</li>
