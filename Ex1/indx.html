  	<strong>1、Separate the sweaters by color if you’re washing more than one.</strong>
  	Dark-colored<br>dyes can bleed a bit when you’re hand-washing, so you’d likely have to change the<br> water before moving on to the light colors if you washed the darks first.[2] Therefore, if<br> you’re hand-washing more than one sweater and the sweaters vary in color, separate them<br> into two piles – one for light colors and one for dark. That way, once you’re ready to wash,<br> you’ll already have them separated so you can easily wash the light-colored pile first.[3]
   <ul>In most cases, you’ll be able to use the same wash set-up for all the sweaters as long as you wash the light colors first.</ul>

     <strong>2、Turn the sweater(s) that you’re washing inside-out.</strong>
 <p>
 	Before hand-washing your<br> sweater, reach up into the sweater and pull the sleeves through to flip it so that the<br> inside is facing out. This will minimize friction while you wash, keeping the outside of the<br> sweater from pilling.[4]
    <ul>If you’re hand-washing more than one sweater, repeat this for all of the sweaters you’re washing.</ul>

  	Fill up a clean sink with room temperature water.
